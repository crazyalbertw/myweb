                    <h3>Kobe Message</h3>
                    <p>Dear Basketball,<br>
                        From the moment <br>
                        I started rolling my dad’s tube socks <br>
                        And shooting imaginary <br>
                        Game-winning shots... <br>
                        In the Great Western Forum <br>
                        I knew one thing was real: <br> <br>
                        I fell in love with you. <br> <br>
                        A love so deep I gave you my all — <br>
                        From my mind & body <br>
                        To my spirit & soul. <br> <br>
                        As a six-year-old boy <br>
                        Deeply in love with you <br>
                        I never saw the end of the tunnel. <br>
                        I only saw myself <br>
                        Running out of one. <br> <br>
                        And so I ran. <br>
                        I ran up and down every court <br>
                        After every loose ball for you. <br>
                        You asked for my hustle <br>
                        I gave you my heart <br>
                        Because it came with so much more. <br> <br>
                        I played through the sweat and hurt <br>
                        Not because challenge called me <br>
                        But because YOU called me. <br>
                        I did everything for YOU <br>
                        Because that’s what you do <br>
                        When someone makes you feel as <br>
                        Alive as you’ve made me feel. <br> <br>
                        You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream <br>
                        And I’ll always love you for it. <br>
                        But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer. <br>
                        This season is all I have left to give. <br>
                        My heart can take the pounding <br>
                        My mind can handle the grind <br>
                        But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye. <br> <br>
                        And that’s OK. <br>
                        I’m ready to let you go. <br>
                        I want you to know now <br>
                        So we both can savor every moment we have left together. <br>
                        The good and the bad. <br>
                        We have given each other <br>
                        All that we have. <br> <br>
                        And we both know, no matter what I do next <br>
                        I’ll always be that kid <br>
                        With the rolled up socks <br>
                        Garbage can in the corner <br>
                        :05 seconds on the clock <br>
                        Ball in my hands. <br>
                        5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1 <br> <br>
                        Love you always, <br>
                        Kobe <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>To my hero Kobe, <br>
                        I started to follow you when <br>
                        I was in the middle school. <br>
                        I was a skinny and ignorant boy <br>
                        who didn't know much about basketball <br>
                        but liked to watch you play.<br>
                        From that time...
